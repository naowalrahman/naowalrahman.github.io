This is my personal website and blog where I post things :)

This website makes use of Boostrap and MathJAX. All except the archived blog are responsive, as the archived blog doesn't use Boostrap. I hope you enjoy browsing through this code -- feel free to make a suggestion via the issues tab if you see any improvements that can be made!
