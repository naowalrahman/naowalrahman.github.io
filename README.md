These are the files for my website where I post things (for now).
I mainly just use this repository to upload the projects that I work on. 
This allows me to share them to others. 

If you have happened to find this repository, I hope you have fun looking through it!

# Blog

I post consistently on my blog every week or two, so be sure to give my posts a look if you have time!
