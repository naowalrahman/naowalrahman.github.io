                    <p>Hey! Even though this is a Khan Academy project, I am writing this on Atom, a text editor that I have because of it's cool features! I hope this is my start to being a dedicated programmer and developer, as I aim to work for Google
                        one day!<br></p>
                    <p>Though this blog isn't that complex, I want to develop apps and algorithms for Google, because that is what I enjoy. However, I can't really do that now (partially because of hardware disadvantage and partially because of knowledge
                        disadvantage).<br></p>

                <p>Hi! I have now switched over to a new text editor that is a LOT better for HTML, JavaScript, and CSS because of it's preview and quick edit features. It's called Brackets! I just switched over from Atom because the live preview didn't
                    work and I couldn't find any aesthetic UI and syntax themes. However, the layout of the UI and the syntax of Brackets is very aesthetic, and the highlights and perfect (in the syntax). I love it! I don't think I'll switch for a long
                    time unless I write code in Python or SQL, which I don't do that often. Web development is my main focus right now.<br></p>
                <p>I feel that the code that I'm writing now isn't that complex; it has basic tags and CSS properties. I want to make a great looking website with drop-down menus and buttons and all of that greatness. It's gonna take a long time to learn
                    that though, but I have all summer!<br></p>

                <p>I've been thinking of making some videos about processing.js. Some ideas I had were about how to actually embed processing.js into an HTML web page, since running it in a JavaScript file doesn't work. Another idea I had was to show people
                    how to make an animation in JavaScript. I could use my shooting star animation as a tutorial just so there'd be a reference. I could also turn both ideas into two separate videos.<br></p>
                <p>There's no point in making a full on processing.js tutorial from basics to the most complex commands because resources like that already exist. However, something like a simple tutorial to actually work on processing.js in your browser
                    doesn't. I only found a small article online about it after tons of searching.<br></p>
                <p>By the way, I have to give <a class="text-primary" data-bs-hover-animate="flash" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQmTY6sLt2NrrGm9iLw-ZxQ" target="_blank">Ahad</a>&nbsp;credit for these ideas because he told me that making videos
                    about coding would be cool. He told me to make something about the basics of JavaScript, which I would've done, but that would be pretty redundant on the YouTube. There's tons of videos like that, plus websites like Khan Academy and
                    FreeCodeCamp. So, I think I'm gonna work on creating a video about the 1st idea I mentioned. I hope it goes well!<br></p>

                <p>Alright, so this is a follow up to my 5th post. I have now actually posted two new videos based on the ideas that Ahad gave me, and I have to say, I enjoyed making these videos! Implementing my knowledge and love for coding into a video
                    that others could watch felt great! Obviously, I didn't get that many views, but I still loved the fact that I could take my passion for video editing along with my passion for coding and writing software and put them together. Originally,
                    I only had gaming videos on my channel, but editing and exporting them was a PAIN. This was because I played on my PS4 Pro, so I had to record it on that, and then transport it to a USB drive. This took ages, as I only have a USB 2.0
                    flash drive. Then the videos were much longer, meaning longer exports and UNBELIEVABLY long export times (my laptop &amp; desktop aren't very powerful). However, with coding videos, I can create short but meaningful ones that aren't
                    that large (in terms of file size) because I have the option to use OBS Studio. Still, I do like making gaming videos and I do plan on making more.<br></p>
                <p>Today, I think I will play some Fortnite with my friends, try to get Aquaman, and also try to go for a 20-30 kill squads game for good content. Then, since I have so much time on my hands, I'll also edit it and leave my computer on for
                    the night for it to upload. It could be a 15-20 minute video.<br></p>
                <p>Also, I have now connected my GitHub account to Unity, so I can now developer games! However, none of the computers in my home are capable enough to run Unity, so I'll have to chill on game development for now (plus, I don't know C/C++).<br></p>
                <p>All in all, I have found my passion (video editing &amp; coding) and am grateful that I have. Because I have so much time this summer, I plan to make use of it!<br></p>

                <h2 id="post9" class="post-title">9th Post:</h2>
                <p>I'm getting the Samsung Galaxy Note20 Ultra! I'll be getting it this week, and I am&nbsp;<strong><em>very</em></strong>&nbsp;excited! It's the US version, meaning a Snapdragon 865+ for maximum and superior performance (compared to the
                    international version with the Exynos 990 processor) with 512 gigabytes of UFS 3.1 storage, which is supposedly better than the S20 Ultra, which has UFS 3.0 storage. The total cost (excluding taxes) is $1450.<br></p>
                <p>The specs of this phone amaze me. From what I've seen and heard from many credible YouTubers, the cameras are the biggest improvement over the S20 Ultra. While the S20 Ultra boasted specs that looked great on paper, it didn't really deliver
                    them well. The 100x zoom was&nbsp;<em>way</em>&nbsp;too grainy, and the 8k recording had terrible focusing and image stabilization. However, this all changes with the Note20 Ultra. It can shoot at 8k 24fps that is actually usable,
                    and has a 108 megapixel sensor. While this is similar to the S20 Ultra, it is delivered much better. Plus, you get a 4500 mAh battery and a 120hz adaptive screen refresh rate.<br></p>
                <p>Overall, I'm really hyped for this phone (it's my first one,😕), and look forward to writing a big review on it once it arrives later this week. The big review will be linked here, as all my posts are, so stay tuned!<br></p>
