            Hey! Even though this is a Khan Academy project, I am writing this on Atom, a text editor that I have because of it's cool features! I hope this is my start to being a dedicated programmer and developer, as I aim to work for Google one day! <br> Though this blog isn't that complex, I want to develop apps and algorithms for Google, because that is what I enjoy. However, I can't really do that now (partially because of hardware disadvantage and partially because of knowledge disadvantage).

            Hi! I have now switched over to a new text editor that is a LOT better for HTML, JavaScript, and CSS because of it's preview and quick edit features. It's called Brackets! I just switched oer from Atom because the live preview didn't work and I could'nt find any aesthetic UI and syntax themes. However, the layout of the UI and the syntax of Brackets is very aesthetic, and the highlights and perfect (in the syntax). I love it! I don't think I'll swtich for a long time unless I write code in Python or SQL, which I don't do that often. Web development is my main focus right now. 
            <br> 
            I feel that the code that I'm writing now isn't that complex; it has basic tags and CSS properties. I want to make a great looking website with dropdown menus and buttons and all of that greatness. It's gonna take a long time to learn that though, but I have all summer!          
        </p>
