            Hey! Even though this is a Khan Academy project, I am writing this on Atom, a text editor that I have because of it's cool features! I hope this is my start to being a dedicated programmer and developer, as I aim to work for Google one day! </p> <p>Though this blog isn't that complex, I want to develop apps and algorithms for Google, because that is what I enjoy. However, I can't really do that now (partially because of hardware disadvantage and partially because of knowledge disadvantage).

            Hi! I have now switched over to a new text editor that is a LOT better for HTML, JavaScript, and CSS because of it's preview and quick edit features. It's called Brackets! I just switched over from Atom because the live preview didn't work and I could'nt find any aesthetic UI and syntax themes. However, the layout of the UI and the syntax of Brackets is very aesthetic, and the highlights and perfect (in the syntax). I love it! I don't think I'll switch for a long time unless I write code in Python or SQL, which I don't do that often. Web development is my main focus right now.          
        </p>
        <p>
          I feel that the code that I'm writing now isn't that complex; it has basic tags and CSS properties. I want to make a great looking website with dropdown menus and buttons and all of that greatness. It's gonna take a long time to learn that though, but I have all summer!

        <p>I've been thinking of making some videos about processing.js. Some ideas I had were about how to actually embed processing.js into an HTML web page, since running it in a JavaScript file doesn't work. Another idea I had was to show people how to make an animation in JavaScript.
          I could use my shooting star animation as a tutorial just so there'd be a reference. I could also turn both ideas into two seperate videos. 
        </p>
        <p>
          There's no point in making a full on processing.js tutorial from basics to the most complex commands because resources like that already exist. However, something like a simple tutorial to actually work on processing.js in your browser doesn't. I only found a small article online about it after tons of searching.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the way, I have to give <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQmTY6sLt2NrrGm9iLw-ZxQ">Ahad</a> credit for these ideas because he told me that making videos about coding would be cool. He told me to make something about the basics of JavaScript, which I would've done, but that would be pretty redundant on the YouTube. There's tons of videos like that, plus websites like Khan Academy and FreeCodeCamp. So, I think I'm gonna work on creating a video about the 1st idea I mentioned. I hope it goes well!

          Alright, so this is a follow up to my 5th post. I have now actually posted two new videos based on the ideas that Ahad gave me, and I have to say, I enjoyed making these videos! Implementing my knowledge and love for coding into a video that others could watch felt great! Obviously, I didn't get that many views, but I still loved the fact that I could take my passion for video editing along with my passion for coding and writing software and put them together. Originally, I only had gaming videos on my channel, but editing and exporting them was a PAIN. This was because I played on my PS4 Pro, so I had to record it on that, and then transport it to a USB drive. This took ages, as I only have a USB 2.0 flash drive. Then the videos were much longer, meaning longer exports and UNBELIEVABLY long export times (my laptop & desktop aren't very powerful). However, with coding videos, I can create short but meaningful ones that aren't that large (in terms of file size) because I have the option to use OBS Studio. Still, I do like making gaming videos and I do plan on making more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, I think I will play some Fortnite with my friends, try to get Aquaman, and also try to go for a 20-30 kill squads game for good content. Then, since I have so much time on my hands, I'll also edit it and leave my computer on for the night for it to upload. It could be a 15-20 minute video.
        </p>
        <p>Also, I have now connected my GitHub account to Unity, so I can now developer games! However, none of the computers in my home are capable enough to run Unity, so I'll have to chill on game development for now (plus, I don't know C/C++).</p>
        <p>
          All in all, I have found my passion (video editing & coding) and am grateful that I have. Because I have so much time this summer, I plan to make use of it!

          I'm getting the Samsung Galaxy Note20 Ultra! I'll be getting it this week, and I am <em><strong>very</strong></em> excited! It's the US version, meaning a SnapDragon 865+ for maximum and superior performance (compared to the international version with the Exynos 990 processor) with 512 gigabytes of UFS 3.1 storage, which is supposedly better than the S20 Ultra, which has UFS 3.0 storage. The total cost (excluding taxes) is $1450.
        </p>
        <p>
          The specs of this phone amaze me. From what I've seen and heard from many credible YouTubers, the cameras are the biggest improvement over the S20 Ultra. While the S20 Ultra boasted specs that looked great on paper, it didn't really deliver them well. The 100x zoom was <em>way</em> too grainy, and the 8k recording had terrible focusing and image stabilization. However, this all changes with the Note20 Ultra. It can shoot at 8k 24fps that is actually usable, and has a 108 megapixel sensor. While this is similar to the S20 Ultra, it is delivered much better. Plus, you get a 4500 mAh battery and a 120hz adaptive screen refresh rate. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, I'm really hyped for this phone (it's my first one, :\), and look forward to writing a big review on it once it arrives later this week. The big review will be linked here, as all my posts are, so stay tuned!
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>EDIT:</strong> I ordered the Note20 Ultra three days ago! It'll be arriving on Saturday, so I'll be posting my review the day after (I'm so hyped!!!). <strong>(Edit made on 9/2/20 at 5:33 PM)</strong>

          So... It's been <strong>THREE MONTHS</strong> since I said that I was going to post a review on my Samsung Galaxy Note20 Ultra... and I haven't done it yet. In fact, I haven't even made any changes to my repository on GitHub since September 2. I guess Stuyvesant's workload got the best of me.
        </p>
        <p>
          If anyone wants to know, by the way, as to how the Note20 Ultra is working out for me, it's an amazing phone! I've never had such an amazing, virtuous, and unique of an experiene on any iPhone. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyway, today is Friday, and I have a little bit of time. I'll talk about my day 😊. I had an AP Biology test, which turned out to be much easier and well-handled than I expected. The most probable reason for this is the sheer amount of studying I've done the past week. Also, now that I'm actually writing on my blog, I now realize that it feels great! It's kind of like talking about nothing important to the non-existent people visiting my website. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Stuyvesant, while a great school, has a proporitonal (sometimes <em>exponential</em>!) workload to match it, especially in AP Biology. This caused me to pause my programming pursuits for a while, including working and writing on this website. I wasn't able to fully learn Python, and now I'm always confused at StuyCCC meetings.
        </p>
        <p>
          I guess I've gotten a little bit on top of my work now, rather than buried beneath it 😂. So, I am now setting a goal for myself to write on my blog frequently. And, <em>maybe</em>, if I have time, finally write that review on my Note20 Ultra. It's a noteworthy and extraordinary phone after all.

          Hello again! I made a goal to write here frequently, so I'm writing here again today. As I've said in previous posts, I haven't yet pursued game development or machine learning in terms of programming not only because of general knowledge, but also because I didn't quite have the hardware to do any of that. This is because game development with Unity requires the C# language, and all C languages are compiled. This means that it is more hardware intensive and also that compile wait times exist. As for me, I'm currently running an Intel i5-7400 with a $50 graphics card that is no longer in production (called the AMD R7 450). What do game development and machine learning both require? A powerful CPU for compiling code an training models, as well as a powerful graphics card. Exactly what I don't have. 
        </p>
        <p>
          That all changes today! I recently ordered another computer, that should definitely be programming ready, as well as programming ready so I can finally switch to PC for playiing video games like Fortnite. However, that isn't the main point here. My new PC was just delivered today, and it's loaded with an Intel i9-10850K and an (!!!) Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070, plus 16 gigabytes of DDR4 3200 mhz memory. I'm gonna be upgrading the SSD on it to a 500 gigabyte PCIe gen 3.0 NVMe SSD, which will be much faster than the pre-installed 480 gigabyte SATA ssd, especially for boot times and compile times. I didn't go PCIe gen 4.0 SSD because Intel processor don't support that standard yet (sad, I know). I'll also be adding an extra 16 gigabytes of RAM to have a total of 32 gigabytes of RAM. 
        </p>
        <p>
          What does this all mean? Well, first of all, this should be beast in what ever game development or machine learning I want to pursue, as well as be an amazing gaming PC. Now, I'm not limited to learn how to use Unity and C#, as well as some machine learning! I'm incredibly happy, I can't even express it. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Sadly, however, I haven't yet ordered my monitor, meaning that I can't really do anything with my PC yet, but I can be patient for that. Hopefully, if my Dad agrees, I'll be getting a <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/viotek-suw49da-49-inch-super-ultrawide-monitor-black/6439477.p?skuId=6439477" target="_blank">49-inch super ultrawide (32:9 aspect ratio) 120hz monitor from Viotek</a>. This is the same as <strong><em>two</em></strong> 27-inch monitors side by side. That's some serious screen real estate. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Other than that, I'm pretty happy anyway today, because I don't have much homework, meaning that I can play a bit more Fortnite with mmy friends and also spend a couple hours (3-4, probably) fully learning the fundamentals of Python on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp</a>. Anyways, that's all I have for today. <strong><em>I hope you enjoyed reading, and have a fantastic day!</em></strong>

          Hi! It's been 14 days since I wrote on this blog, and a lot has happened since then. In case you're wondering why I haven't been able to write, it's the usual; catching up on homework. Seriously, homework is annoying. Anyways, talking about what's up. 
        </p>
        <p>
          So, the biggest thing is that I ordered the monitor for my new PC yesterday (!!!). Though I was planning on getting either a single 49 inch monitor or two monitors (for a dual monitor setup), my parents said that I was only allowed to have one singular monitor that wasn't <em>as big</em> as the 49-inch monitor that I originally wanted. So, I settled on a <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/viotek-gnv34dbe-34-uwqhd-curved-gaming-monitor-144hz-1440p-3-year-warranty-hdmi-dp-black/6420872.p?skuId=6420872" target="blank">single 34-inch monitor from Viotek</a>, which should provide a nice, smooth gaming experience with the Nvidia GeFroce RTX 3070 in my PC, as well as ample space for productivity, though not as much as my previous configurations. It'll be arriving in a week or so, so that's fun!
        </p>
        <p>
          There's stuff that happened before me ordering this monitor, but it's pretty boring. It was pretty normal stuff - homework, an AP Biology test (which I may have passed, may have failed, depending on how lucky I get). But, the best occasion, which will surprise some and will seem normal to others, happened today! 
        </p>
        <p>
          So, what happened today?
        </p>
        <p>
          I switched to linux! Well, I didn't completely commit myself to ussing linux, but I have a linux distro on my PC now, so I can dual boot with both linux and Windows 10. The linux distro that I found most appealing and most supported was Ubuntu, so installed <a href="https://ubuntu.com/" target="blank">Ubuntu 20.04 LTS</a> on my system. I have to admit, though linux is less feature rich that Windows 10, it is certainly a <strong>lot</strong> faster than Windows 10 and much more programming oriented. Some things that needed lots of setup on Windows 10 just work on Ubuntu. An example of this would be programming with <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="blank">Git</a> and <a href="https://desktop.github.com/" target="blank">GitHub Desktop</a>. All I had to do to set it up was run<code>sudo apt install git</code> and install a modified version of GitHub Desktop for linux to get my workflow up and running. It even automatically set up source control on Visual Studio Code for me. Programming on this was just such a treat! Obviously, this type of situation can also be applied on Windows 10, where some things on Windows 10 just work, like setting up Google Drive sync. All I had to do on Windows 10 to get Google Drive working was install <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/7491144?utm_medium=et&utm_source=aboutdrive&utm_content=getstarted&utm_campaign=en_us&hl=en" target="blank">Google Drive File Stream</a> and log in, and that was it; I had a Google Drive client on my PC. However, with Ubuntu, because the native app wasn't available for linux, I had to try out 3 different third party Google Drive clients until I found something that was actually usable and worked. I tried <a href="https://github.com/hschauhan/gosync">GoSync</a>, which was impossible for me to setup, then <a href="https://github.com/vitalif/grive2" target="blank">Grive2</a>, which was apparently blocked by Google for "safety reasons," and then I finally tried <a href="https://github.com/MasterSoft24/cloudcross" target="blank">CloudCross</a>, which worked. I already knew about CloudCross and its efficiency on the enterprise level, but GoSync and Grive2 had an actual GUI and autosync, which is really convenient. However, with CloudCross, not only do I have to manually sync my files, everything is CLI based and local. So, it's not the most convenient setup in  the world, but it works. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Other than those types of small inconveniences in Ubuntu/linux in general, I love using it! Its lightweight architecture makes my current computer (not my new one) feel refreshingly fast, and I have a lot more freedom in terms of customization and what I can modify. Using the terminal is great as well, though it can be a pain sometimes when things don't work out. Other than that, I'm enjoying Ubuntu a lot! 
        </p>
        <p>
          Moving on from my experience with linux, lets talk about winter break! It starts this Thursday, and I'm really excited! I won't have much homework according to my teachers, and whatever homework I do have will be done on the first day, so I can sleep 24/7 afterwards (just kidding). Other than grinding homework on the first day, I plan on fully learning the essentials of C++ as well as competitive programming algortihms. Im part of the Stuyvesant Competitive Computing Club, and often times when they teach a new concept, I don't understand any of it. For programming, listening isn't enough. I need to be taught step by step. The club sort of introduces the concept and explains how it works, but I don't get where the solutions are coming from. So, I'm going to relearn more competitive programming skills (things like Big O notation, different algorithms, graphs, etc). Hopefully, I have a productive winter break!\

          I have nothing more to say, so thanks for reading! I ranted a little more than usual, so sorry for that. Have a wonderful day, whoever you are.
