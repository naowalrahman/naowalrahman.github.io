    <h1>Hyperskill: How is it?</h1>    
    <p>
        This is a review on <a href="https://hyperskill.org/">Hyperskill</a>, a website by <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/">JetBrains</a> that lets you learn how to program in many languages, like Java, Python, and Kotlin. However, since I haven’t been able to test out all of their languages, the reviews and judgments will be based on my experience with their Python developer course.
    </p>
    <h2>What is Hyperskill?</h2>
    <p>
        As you might have guessed from the previous paragraph, Hyperskill is an online resource that people can use to learn how to code. It is mainly supported languages are Java, Python, and Kotlin. Though they also have a web development course, it is still in its infancy, so I would recommend something else if you want to learn HTML / JavaScript. 
    </p>
    <p>
        All their main programming courses are very extensive and cover every topic you will need (almost ever!) to master that language. Not only do they teach you about the syntax and how the language works, but they also inform you about real-world applications for each topic. They even teach you the command-line and how to interact with your operating system so you can extend your coding knowledge to a legitimate usage area! 
    </p>
    <p>
        So yes, Hyperskill does teach you a lot and has a wide coverage of topics and lessons of whichever programming language you choose to learn. 
    </p>
    <p>
        However, while all of this sounds great when described, what is the actual user experience of the platform, and does it help you to completely learn a programming language like Python?
    </p>
    <h2>Is it effective?</h2>
    <p>
        Hyperskill is effective in some cases and not in others and can even be annoying to use in a few cases. However, I’d say that it does teach you the proper things despite the sometimes-frustrating moments and that the overall user experience and GUI are okay.
    </p>
    <p>
        While learning and going through lessons/topics, the articles are quite informative, and usually teach you what is needed to answer questions on that topic as well as use it in an actual program. For instance, if you were learning about tuples in Python, it would tell you what tuples are, how to use them, and when to use them. This is helpful, as it lets you fully grasp the topic, rather than just learning the syntax. 
    </p>
    <figure>
        <img src="/images/hyperskill review pictures/beginning of theory.png" alt="beginning of theory">
        <figcaption>This is the beginning of the 'theory', as Hyperskill calls it, where it explains what a tuple is.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
        <img src="/images/hyperskill review pictures/article showing syntax.png" alt="article showing syntax">
        <figcaption>Here you can see the article showing you the syntax of a tuple.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
        <img src="/images/hyperskill review pictures/showing real life applications.png" alt="the theory shows the real life applications of a tuple">
        <figcaption>In this section, they explain to you when to use a tuple and when it gives you an advantage in real life.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
        Each article (about a topic) is divided into sections and ends with a conclusion about the topic, summing up the basics of what was taught. 
    </p>
    <p>
        When you are done reading, you are presented with questions and coding problems about the topic that help you to apply what you have learned. The questions judge what you have learned from the reading and the coding problems test how well you can apply the concepts taught. These coding problems are where those frustrating moments that I talked about previously come in. Sometimes, your answer will be completely correct, but the problem will say it’s wrong because you have an extra space somewhere or you wrote the variables in the wrong order (in the context of Python).
    </p>
    <p>
        For instance, if they told you to define the 3 variables “numbers,” “strings,” and “language,” and you defined them in a different order than what was originally stated, it'd be wrong. Problems like these slow down your learning path, as in reality, the program works. It is only Hyperskill’s interpretation of your code that’s slowing you down. Still, the comments section has tons of people giving you hints and disclaimers if you do get stuck. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Speaking of the comments section, this is one of the most helpful parts of Hyperskill. If you are stuck on a question or notice flaws, there will most likely be tons of people in comments sections giving you hints on how to solve it or how to get past flaws in question.
    </p>
    <figure>
        <img src="/images/hyperskill review pictures/example hint.png" alt="an example of a hint">
        <figcaption>Hints like these can be found in the comments section and can help you enhance your learning experience at Hyperskill.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h2>Price</h2>
    <p>
        From the previous section, my description of Hyperskill and its effectiveness has mostly been positive. However, now I shall present to you one of the worst parts of Hyperskill: the price.
    </p>
    <p>
        They have a subscription-based plan, and it costs $25 per month for the first year and $50 per month afterward. This seems a bit excessive for a development course website. After all, there are websites like <a href="https://www.educative.io/">Educative</a> and <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/">Frontend Masters</a> that can teach you many of the same skills at a much, much, lower subscription price, and sometimes even a one-time payment. Then again, there are also places like <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/"></a>FreeCodeCamp that are completely free.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently, I’m on the free trial of Hyperskill. It starts as a 7-day trial but extends by 1 month when you complete a stage of a project and extends again when you complete an entire project. This means you can experience it for free for about 2.25 months before you have to pay. I’ve been doing Hyperskill for 2-3 hours per day for that last month and I’ve only finished around 20% of their Python developer course. I probably won’t finish the entire course by September 21 (when my trial ends), so I’d be forced to pay (which I won’t do).
    </p>
    <p>
        So, I’d say that this is the largest downside to learning from Hyperskill. The price is atrocious and gets close to the prices of professional software plans like the <a href="https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html">Creative Cloud</a> from <a href="https://www.adobe.com/">Adobe</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        From this, it can be said that Hyperskill is very effective for the most part, at least in my experience. It teaches you very well and also shows you how to apply what you have learned to the real world. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The experience learning form Hyperskill is great, and it does teach you a lot. You learn what something is, the syntax of it (or learning how to use it), and why / how you should apply it in the real world. But, their practice problems of the concepts you learn is ok but does have flaws.
    </p>
    <p>
        Overall, I’d say that if you’re willing to shell off $50 a month to learn how to code, you should definitely try Hyperskill!
