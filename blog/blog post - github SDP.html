    <h1>I got the GitHub Student Developer Pack!</h1> 
    <p>
        Now, if you're not really into coding and don't use development apps/websites, you're probably wondering: "What's so special about it?" Well, there's a lot about this pack that is very special and <strong>monetarily</strong> valuable.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let me just start off by saying that the tools in this pack are probably worth a few thousand dollars. Yes, that's not a typo!
    </p>
    <p>
        Not only do you get amazing development tools like ALL of the <a href="https://jetbrains.com" target="_blank">JetBrains</a> IDEs (worth $649 per year) and <a href="https://www.gitkraken.com/pricing" target="_blank">GitKraken Pro</a> (worth $79 per year), but you also get long trials to development courses on websites like <a href="https://www.educative.io/" target="_blank"> Educative</a>, <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/" target="_blank">Frontend Masters</a>, <a href="https://next.tech" target="_blank">Next.Tech</a>, and more. And the thing is, all the development tools that you get are with you until you <strong>graduate from college</strong>. Since I'm starting 9th grade this September, I get all those development tools for EIGHT YEARS. That means that just the JetBrains IDEs cost a total of $5192, and I get it for free! And that's just one service that this pack has.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to all that, you also get a free domain from name.com for a year, free software like <a href="https//unity.com" target="_blank">Unity</a> (the game development tool that is used to make half of the world's games) and things like <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/" target="_blank"> DigitalOcean</a> that help you to deploy your code & apps to the web & cloud.

    <p>
        GitHub isn't wrong when they say that this pack will teach you how to ship software like a pro. It really will. If you use all those services and put effort into creating software, you <em><strong>will</strong></em> become a great developer.
    </p>
    <p>
        Honestly, I didn't even think my request for this pack would get accepted. When I first made my GitHub account to host this website on Github Pages, Github told me to check out the Student Developer Pack. At first I thought it wouldn't be that great, considering it's completely free, but no, it was GREAT. I decided to apply for it, since I had a .edu email from Stuyvesant, but I didn't think they would approve my request. After all, my confirmation of my indentity was just a picture of my Talos account page! But, surprisingly, they approved it. And it's a good thing they did. Now I'm going to spend my summer using all those development tools and learning from all those courses 12/7 (24/7 is too much).

    <p>
        This pack really does have everything I need to build anything! They sent me this email yesterday, telling me that my request was approved. Just recieving this email made me jump and inspired me just code as much as I can.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you like to code and build software, I recommend you submit a request for this pack. It's amazing and will make any developer on any level happy. You'll get:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Software development IDEs</li>
        <li>Git management tools</li>
        <li>Free domains</li>
        <li>Development learning courses</li>
        <li>And much, much, more!</li>
    </ul>
